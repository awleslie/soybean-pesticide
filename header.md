### Soybean Pesticide Selection Tool  
This tool was developed to help select pesticides for managing insect and weed pests in soybeans. 

First: Select your key pests from the list on the left.

Second: Check the tables at the top for products with the highest efficacy scores for those pests.

Third: Choose your pesticides from the drop-down menus below.
  
Once you have selected your pesticides, click the "Generate report" button to save your spray program as a pdf document. Information entered by users is NOT saved on the server, and is only saved locally on the user's computer by clicking the "Generate report" button.
